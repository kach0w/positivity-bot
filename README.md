# Positivity Bot

I created a discord bot for <a href="https://fremont-hacks-2.devpost.com">Fremont Hacks 2023</a>. I had a great time building it especially since I got the chance to learn more about sentiment analysis and machine learning as well as node js. The bot works by going through a user's last 100 messages and using sentiment analysis assigns a score for negative qualities. If the average of all the negative scores is greater than 50 than the bot tells admin that the user has been negative. Here's the <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1099755600038072461&permissions=8&scope=bot">link</a> to invite this bot in your own servers.
